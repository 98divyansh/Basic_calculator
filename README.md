# About calculator
This code provides a basic calculator functionality, allowing users to perform simple calculations interactively.
However, it lacks error handling for cases like division by zero or non-numeric input, which you might want to add for robustness.
Additionally, it's a command-line program, so there is no graphical user interface (GUI). It's a simple demonstration of how to structure a text-based calculator in Python.
